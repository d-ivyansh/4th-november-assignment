In JavaScript, operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Operators can be categorized based on their functionality. 
Here are the main categories of operators in JavaScript along with examples:

Arithmetic Operators:
Perform mathematical operations on numbers.{console.log(a + b);}

Comparison Operators:
Compare values and return a Boolean result.{console.log(x > y);}

Logical Operators:
Combine or manipulate Boolean values.{console.log(p && q);}

Assignment Operators:
Assign values to variables.{num += 5;}

Unary Operators:
Operate on a single operand.{console.log(++count);}

Bitwise Operators:
Perform operations at the binary level.{console.log(m & n);}

Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
A shorthand way of writing an if-else statement.
{
    let age = 20;
    let status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
    console.log(status);
}
