**Importance of Comments in JavaScript:**

Comments in JavaScript serve as non-executable text that provides additional information about the code. They are crucial for enhancing code readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers. Here are some key reasons why comments are important:

1. **Documentation:** Comments document the purpose, functionality, and usage of code elements. This helps other developers (or even yourself in the future) understand how different parts of the code work.

2. **Explanation of Logic:** Comments can explain complex or non-intuitive sections of code, making it easier for others to follow the logic and reasoning behind specific decisions.

3. **Debugging and Troubleshooting:** Comments can be used to temporarily disable or "comment out" sections of code during debugging. This helps in identifying the source of errors or testing alternative implementations.

4. **Collaboration:** In a team environment, comments facilitate collaboration by providing insights into the code for other team members. They help ensure that everyone is on the same page regarding the code's functionality.

5. **Code Review:** Comments are valuable during code reviews. They enable reviewers to understand the thought process behind certain implementations and provide feedback effectively.

**Examples of Single-Line and Multi-Line Comments:**

1. **Single-Line Comments:**
   - Single-line comments are used for short explanations or notes on a single line of code.

   ```javascript
   // This is a single-line comment
   let age = 25;  // Variable representing the age
   ```

2. **Multi-Line Comments:**
   - Multi-line comments are used for more extensive explanations, documentation, or commenting out large sections of code.

   ```javascript
   /*
      This is a multi-line comment
      It can span multiple lines
      and is useful for providing detailed explanations.
   */
   let total = 0;
   // The following block of code is temporarily commented out for debugging
   /*
   for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
      total += i;
   }
   */
   ```
