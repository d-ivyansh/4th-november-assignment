JavaScript has five primitive data types, which are basic data types that are not objects and do not have methods. These primitive types are:

1. **String:**
   - Represents a sequence of characters and is enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or backticks (\` \`) quotes.
   - Examples:
     ```javascript
     let name = 'John';
     let message = "Hello, World!";
     let backticksExample = `This is a template literal`;
     ```

2. **Number:**
   - Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
   - Examples:
     ```javascript
     let age = 25;
     let pi = 3.14;
     ```

3. **Boolean:**
   - Represents a logical entity with two values: `true` or `false`.
   - Used for logical operations and conditional expressions.
   - Examples:
     ```javascript
     let isStudent = true;
     let isLoggedIn = false;
     ```

4. **Undefined:**
   - Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   - Variables are automatically initialized to `undefined` when declared.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let x;
     console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined
     ```

5. **Null:**
   - Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
   - It is often used to indicate that a variable has no assigned value or that a function returns no valid object.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let car = null;
     ```
